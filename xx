Hi everyone, I’m Sushobhan Roy. I’m from Konnagar, West Bengal, and currently in my 8th semester of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science at C.V. Raman Global University, Odisha. I’m quite comfortable working with Java and databases, and I’m currently interning at Cognizant Technology Solutions as part of their Java Full Stack Engineer training program. As part of my internship, I’m working on a project focused on employee attendance, leave, and shift management. Apart from tech, I’m also someone who enjoys staying updated with current affairs and spending time drawing whenever I get the chance.
